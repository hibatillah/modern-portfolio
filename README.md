### Portfolio project

The first step that i did first was to seek inspiration from various design sources, collect various appropriate references. Then make a design, at this stage i use Figma, here's a [preview of the portfolio design](https://www.figma.com/proto/vKBWGWtDWUEoOzEfooYYMz/mine?page-id=2%3A34&node-id=938-1686&viewport=18%2C23%2C0.41&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=938%3A1686). After it is described in the design, then implementation is carried out in the code.<br><br>
